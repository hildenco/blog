I was trying to write a simple crawler to validate some resources against some URLs on a page with PowerShell and was got the error:

The server committed a protocol violation

After googling ducking around, I found three different solutions for this problem:

    Modifying your powershell.exe.config;
    Modifying your request in order to avoid it stopping if your url is invalid in .NET
    Modifying your request in order to avoid it stopping if your url is invalid in PowerShell.

Let's review each of them and understand a little more about the problem. 

## Solution 1 - Modifying powershell.exe.config
This solution will apply to all PowerShell requests so use with caution. Also, this solution is not portable so, if you plan to run this script on a machine you don't have admin access to, this solution will probably not work.
```cs
<system.net>
 <settings>
  <httpWebRequest useUnsafeHeaderParsing="true" />
 </settings>
</system.net>
```

## Solution 2 - Modifying your request in .NET
To modify your request, have the code below before you actually run Invoke-WebRequest:

```PowerShell
$netAssembly = [Reflection.Assembly]::GetAssembly([System.Net.Configuration.SettingsSection])
if($netAssembly)
{
    $bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] "Static,GetProperty,NonPublic"
    $settingsType = $netAssembly.GetType("System.Net.Configuration.SettingsSectionInternal")

    $instance = $settingsType.InvokeMember("Section", $bindingFlags, $null, $null, @())

    if($instance)
    {
        $bindingFlags = "NonPublic","Instance"
        $useUnsafeHeaderParsingField = $settingsType.GetField("useUnsafeHeaderParsing", $bindingFlags)

        if($useUnsafeHeaderParsingField)
        {
          $useUnsafeHeaderParsingField.SetValue($instance, $true)
        }
    }
}

```

## Solution 3 - Modifying your request in PowerShell
This is probably the simplest. Just run the line below:
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = { $true }
